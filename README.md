XHTML Entities
==========================

This utility class encodes and decodes HTML and XML entities. Originally the idea came from an Android project, because `android.text.Html` does not support all entities or like i.e. 'â€ž' (`&bdquo;` or `&#8222;`).  
Version 2.0 is completely rewritten. It now uses Reader and Writer for better performance and less memory footprint.

Limits:

1. `Entities` does not fix broken entities like `&xAD;` (here a `#` is missing) 
2. Not all entities from 
[https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref) 
are supported yet

Note 1: the code is written for **Java 1.6** to keep it Android-ready.

Note 2: an apdaption for the Android platform might utilize `android.util.SparseArray` instead of `Map<Integer, String>` for the internal `encodeMap`.
